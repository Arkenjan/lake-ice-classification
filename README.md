# lake-ice-classification
Google Earth Engine interface to aid building training data for classifying ice formation on lake surfaces

## setup the script
1. copy and paste the template code in the UI_training_data.js file to a new Google Earth Engine script, and save the script;
2. run the script, and when the interface appears on the map, click on the "next" button to go to the first lake, or enter the lake index directly in the textbox to the right of the "next" button;
3. save frequently, and when you're done for the day, save the script first then export the data by running the script and initiate the task.
